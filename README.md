* I would like to describe GitHub accordingly, but this week was my first time 
  I heard about GitHub. There is a lot I need to learn!

* I followed the assignment instructions to create the repository. I give a meaningful 
  name as the prompt suggested and save the file under my Wake Tech file directory
  for an organized and easy access.
 
* I followed the steps to clone my repository from my GitHub account but encountered some issues. 
  When I made the clone, I moved it to my wake tech file; this changed the file path, creating a discrepancy. 
 
  The steps I followed to create the clone:
           - On the GitHub page, I selected clone from the right pane.
           - this opens a new window indicating where to save the file.
           - I chose my Wake Tech directory for easy access. 

# About Me 

 I am from the Dominican Republic but have lived in North Carolina for three years. I have been married for almost ten years. Also, I have a beautiful eight-year-old girl who loves art, like me and my dad! My father was a graphic designer and _a traditional artist_, and this influenced me and my life path; under him, I learned the art fundamentals. With the addition of my love for computers, I discovered digital art, and ever since then, it has been part of my art journey.

2. Profesional growth websites:

     - I discovered this platform through WTCC. What I like the most about this platform is the learning section and how much advantage someone can take from it.

     - This was the most underated website from my part, until I started learning HTML and CSS and I had to rely on Youtube to solve some problem.
