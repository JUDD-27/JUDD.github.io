* I would like to describe GitHub accordingly, but this week was my first time 
  I heard about GitHub. There is a lot I need to learn!

* I followed the assignment instructions to create the repository. I give a meaningful 
  name as the prompt suggested and save the file under my Wake Tech file directory
  for an organized and easy access.
 
* I followed the steps to clone my repository from my GitHub account but encountered some issues. 
  When I made the clone, I moved it to my wake tech file; this changed the file path, creating a discrepancy. 
 
  The steps I followed to create the clone:
           - On the GitHub page, I selected clone from the right pane.
           - this opens a new window indicating where to save the file.
           - I chose my Wake Tech directory for easy access.
