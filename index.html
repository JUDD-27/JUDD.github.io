        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Jendy; I am from the Dominican Republic. I grew up in a small tourist town on the north coast called Sosua; I lived here most of my life. I moved to North Carolina three years ago. after settling down with my family, I decided it was time for me to return to school. I enrolled for the Visual Arts Associate, but later on, I decided I wanted to pursue a more demanding path, which is how I ended up in UX Design and CyberSercurityâ€”I know these associates are time demanding and might be complicated at the time, but I have enjoyed each semester so far.</p>

        <p>As for my personal life, I have been married for almost ten years. Also, I have an eight-year-old girl who loves to draw and the beach like me. I am a digital illustrator and ink artist, taught mainly by my father, a painter and graphic designer.</p>
